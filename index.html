        <p>Scouts can complete activities to earn badges. There are 4 types of badges: Challenge badges, which are the main badges which scouts aspire to get, Activity badges, which you can earn by completing various activities, ranging from flying to art to geocaching to science. There are also staged badges, which have different levels to complete as you advance through them. The final type of badges are core badges, which show your membership, patrol and rank.</p>

        <p>The scout uniform consists of a green shirt and a necker with a woggle, which is essentially a small band to hold the necker in place. Badges, once earned, are sewn onto the scout uniform. From the ages of 14-18, you become an explorer scout, and the only difference in uniform is that the shirt is a khaki brown colour.</p>
